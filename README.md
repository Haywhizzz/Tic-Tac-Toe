## How To Play

- Players take turns playing
- First turn — Player 1
- Player 1 places their token (X) in only 1 square of their choice
- Puts player 1's name and will tell that their turn
- Second turn — Player 2
- Player 2 places their token (O) in only 1 square of their choice, except they can’t touch the square that Player 1’s token already fills
- Puts player 1's name and will tell that their turn
- 3rd turn- Player 1 …. and the cycle continues until a player wins or there’s a tie game
- There are 8 winning combinations: Top row, Middle row, Bottom row, Left column, Middle column, Right column, Left diagonal, and Right diagonal
- There’s a draw when the entire board is filled with X’s and O’s but no winning combinations can be found
